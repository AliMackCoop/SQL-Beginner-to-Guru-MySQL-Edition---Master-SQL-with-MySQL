Alright! Welcome to the course. In this
section of the course, we're gonna start

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.790
laying down a baseline. What we need to
do is start establishing a common

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.910
terminology and some of the terminology
around SQL like what is a database? What

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.720
is a relational model? And things like
that. We have some lectures in this

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.900
section of the course. They are just
Powerpoints. They're going to talk about

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.279
the history of SQL and MySQL, about
the programming languages, some the key

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.600
concepts so we can get that base
terminology down and we're gonna get

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.680
some hands-on too. So I'm gonna keep it a
little bit fluid but we also need to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.660
kind of start establishing a baseline of
some common terminology that we can use

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.289
going forward.
So I'm gonna try to make it too boring

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.289
because I know saying through
powerpoints can be pretty slow and

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.430
boring but hopefully you'll get a lot of
benefit and start a really understanding

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.079
why SQL is used? Where it came from?
How it came to be? And little bit of a

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.270
history of SQL in the industry.
