00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,400
Alright! Welcome to the course. In this
section of the course, we're gonna start

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,790
laying down a baseline. What we need to
do is start establishing a common

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,910
terminology and some of the terminology
around SQL like what is a database? What

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,720
is a relational model? And things like
that. We have some lectures in this

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,900
section of the course. They are just
Powerpoints. They're going to talk about

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,279
the history of SQL and MySQL, about
the programming languages, some the key

7
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,600
concepts so we can get that base
terminology down and we're gonna get

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,680
some hands-on too. So I'm gonna keep it a
little bit fluid but we also need to

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,660
kind of start establishing a baseline of
some common terminology that we can use

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,289
going forward.
So I'm gonna try to make it too boring

11
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,289
because I know saying through
powerpoints can be pretty slow and

12
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,430
boring but hopefully you'll get a lot of
benefit and start a really understanding

13
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,079
why SQL is used? Where it came from?
How it came to be? And little bit of a

14
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,270
history of SQL in the industry.
